# ThermalLaserSD
Code for Dr Michel Lemay's computerized laser diode system that can measure the withdrawal time to a heat stimulus applied to the plantar 
surface of the foot in a large animal model of spinal cord injury. The system provides automatic measurement of the paw withdrawal latency
time and stores the values for later export.
